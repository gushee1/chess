Chess simulator in C++

This project contains a C++ header and main file that, when run can execute a two player game of chess with standard rules

Here are some features I plan on adding in future versions:

1) pawn promotion when a pawn reaches the end of a board
2) automatic check recognition (completed) and ending the game in checkmate (incomplete)
3) castling (completed)
4) the en passant move
5) a bot for players to play against (the current plan is to create a bot that will execute a random valid move each time it is the bot's turn)

Long term goals for this project include integrating it into a website and adding JavaScript animations to create a more widely usable playing experience, and creating a bot that will play according to basic chess principles, such as control the middle, develop pieces quickly, etc...

I hope you enjoy the simulator!!!
